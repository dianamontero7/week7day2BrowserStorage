BrowserStorage

To keep building from our starting point in yesterday's lab, COPY your src folder into this repo.

Implement localStorage in your app so that you data from 1 page can persist and carry over to another.

When creating a new order, the Order Page should use ```JSON.stringify()``` and ```localStorage.setItem()``` 
- If continuing an existing order, ```JSON.parse()``` and ```localStorage.getItem()``` should be used to access the previous configuration

The view page should use ```JSON.parse()``` and ```localStorage.getItem()``` to access the order and display it's contents on screen.
